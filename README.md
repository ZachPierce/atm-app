# Overview

This was a simple project that emulates a very basic ATM. I wanted to get familiar with using react/node and postgres in a full stack context.

# Getting Started with the ATM APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Then run 

### `npm start`

This will start the app on localhost:3000

Once that is running youll want to make sure you have the postgres database running by running 

### `docker-compose up -d`

Once that is up and running youll navigate to the "src" directory and run 

### `node server.js`

This will start the api and everything will be good to go and you can play with the ATM!
